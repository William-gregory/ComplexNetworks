## Complex Networks
A python library for creating complex networks of geospatial time series data, with an accompanying Jupyter notebook containing an example of generating complex networks of sea surface temperature data.

The ComplexNetworks.py code requires the following python libraries to be installed:

`NumPy`
`SciPy`

For plotting in the Jupyter notebook, I have made use of:

`Matplotlib`
`Basemap`
`Networkx`

The network methodology used here is based on work by:

`Fountalis, I., Bracco, A. and Dovrolis, C., 2014. Spatio-temporal network analysis for studying climate patterns. Climate dynamics, 42(3-4), pp.879-899.` [Fountalis et al., 2014](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/constantinos.dovrolis/Papers/ilias-climdyn14.pdf),

however the code in this repository was written and implemented for use in the following article: 

`Gregory, W., Tsamados, M., Stroeve, J. and Sollich, P., 2020. Regional September Sea Ice Forecasting with Complex Networks and Gaussian Processes. Weather and Forecasting, 35(3), pp.793-806.`

Therefore please cite [Gregory et al., 2020](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10091542/1/Gregory_wafd190107.pdf) if you wish to reproduce this code.
