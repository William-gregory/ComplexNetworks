## Complex Networks
A python library for creating complex networks of geospatial time series data, with an accompanying Jupyter notebook containing an example of generating complex networks of sea surface temperature data.

The ComplexNetworks.py code requires the following python libraries to be installed:

`NumPy`
`SciPy`

For plotting in the Jupyter notebook, I have made use of:

`Matplotlib`
`Basemap`
`Networkx`
